RELEASE: 3.44
CHANGES: tr7203
1) copied snpmrkwithin.py from trunk to get query time reporting that
   was added after tr7203 branch was created
2) snpmrklocation.py - load snp..MRK_Location_Cache
3) snpmarker.csh - updated to load to SNP database, and run snpmrklocation.py
4) snpmarker.py - updated to talk to SNP database, removed
   created/modified, updated _Feature_key to _Coord_Cache_key, 
   get mgd keys from configuration (ldb, mgitype)
5) Configuration.default - added ldb, mgityp keys, added
   SNP_DBSCHEMA, MRKLOC_CACHETABLE, MRKLOC_CACHEFILE
6) snpmrkwithin.py - updated to use binary search to find markers by
   chromosome and only process a configurable set of consensus snps
   on that chromosome at a time.
7) snpmrklocus.py - updated to talk to snp database, new locus-region
   upstream/downstream algorithm
8) Install - added creation of output directories

     branched off of tag snpcacheload-tr7203-1

STAFF: sc
RELEASE:
CHANGES:
1) Configuration.defaults - added MAX_BCP_LINES
  and MAX_QUERY_BATCH
2) snpcoord.py, snpmarker.py, snpmrkwithin.py - 
   removed created/modified by/date from bcp file
3) snpmarker.csh - processes multiple snpmrkwithin.py bcp files
4) snpmrkwithin.py - now creates multiple  bcp files based on 
   a configurable number of rows. This is because bcp executed
   from a shell script doesn't recognize files > 2Gb
   - now processes in batches (configurable size) of 
   _ConsensusSnp_keys's instead of by chromosome, this is
   because of python memory errors when query is too large
