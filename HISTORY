CHANGES: Branch point tag for SNP Shoe horn tr7392
     branched off of tag snpcacheload-tr7203-1

TAG: snpcacheload-tr7203-1
DATE: 1/19/2006
STAFF: sc
RELEASE:
CHANGES:
1) Configuration.defaults - added MAX_BCP_LINES
  and MAX_QUERY_BATCH
2) snpcoord.py, snpmarker.py, snpmrkwithin.py - 
   removed created/modified by/date from bcp file
3) snpmarker.csh - processes multiple snpmrkwithin.py bcp files
4) snpmrkwithin.py - now creates multiple  bcp files based on 
   a configurable number of rows. This is because bcp executed
   from a shell script doesn't recognize files > 2Gb
   - now processes in batches (configurable size) of 
   _ConsensusSnp_keys's instead of by chromosome, this is
   because of python memory errors when query is too large
